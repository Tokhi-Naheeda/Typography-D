# Typography-Site

In this project, I applied the basics of typography to create an appealing website. I converted a Markdown document with typographic articles into a well-structured website, using HTML and CSS to implement various fonts, layouts, and styles.

### Features
- Converting Markdown content into a structured and stylish webpage.
- Applying typography principles and CSS styling to optimize readability and design.
- Creating a user-friendly navigation with internal links.
- Styling links in different states (link, visited, active, hover).

### Example
