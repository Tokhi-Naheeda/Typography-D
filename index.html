            <h3>The Elements of Typographic Style</h3>
            <p class="schriftsteller">by Robert Bringhurst</p>
            <p>Often referred to as <em>"The Typographer's Bible,"</em> Chapter 6 of The Elements of
                Typographic Stylecovers Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to
                "Choose faces that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
                conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the subject." He
                tells us to "start with a single typographic family," but when the time comes to
                combine fonts, "balance the type optically more than mathematically.</p>
                <h3>Nice Web Type</h3>
                <p class="schriftsteller">by Tim Brown</p>
                <p><em> Web Type strikes</em> a balance between typographic artistry and technical
                know-how. In the "fonts" section of the site Brown writes, "You may have
                noticed, there are lots of typefaces out there to choose among. Here you'll find
                the ones I prefer, and my reasons.

                <h3>The Elements of Typographic Style</h3>
                <p class="schriftsteller">by Robert Bringhurst</p>
                <p>While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love for ideas and
                 a love for the letters and words used to make ideas visible.<em>The Elements of
                 Typographic Style</em> teaches the basics of honoring and respecting the written word
                 -- through choosing and combining typefaces; strivingfor rhythm, proportion,
                 and harmony; and designing typographic pages.</p>
                 <h3>I Love Typography</h3>
                 <p class="schriftsteller">by John Boardley </p>
                 <p>From the website: <em>I love Typography (ILT) </em>was born on August 7, 2007. It exists
                 because I have a passion for typography, type design, and lettering, and for the
                  words born of those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us
                  to draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had an extra
                 bit at the top. This site aims to make the subjectmore accessible, to bring the
                 study of typography to the masses, if you will. It's just about impossible to
                imagine a world without type, but at the same time type's ubiquity has most of
                 us taking it for granted. So take a closer look.</p>
                 <h3>Love and Joy About Letters</h3>
                 <p class="schriftsteller">by Ben Shahn</p>
                 <p>Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work often
                including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a lithographer. <em>In
                 Love and Joy About Letters</em> he writes: "I discovered the Roman alphabet in all
                 its elegance and its austere dignity, and I fell in love all over again with
                 letters… Letters are quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and
                 the hand can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
                 sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are the
                balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter of skill and
                feeling and art.
